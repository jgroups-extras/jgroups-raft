/**
 * Keep track of part of the algorithm state. The state here is tightly synchronized and needs to be updated atomically.
 * <p>
 * Throughout the RAFT execution, the node updates the values for term, leader, and the election vote. The values need
 * to be updated atomically, following the term transition. This synchronization is necessary for clients to perceive
 * the same leaders and terms.
 * <p>
 * Utilizing both Ongaro's dissertation<sup>1</sup> and the original RAFT<sup>2</sup> article as the base. The relation
 * of all these variables in the state may not be clear. Starting with the assertion that a term only starts through a
 * new election. In other words, when updating the term, the leader is unknown. The term increases monotonically, and
 * some nodes might skip it due to connectivity issues.
 * <p>
 * All messages carry the sender's current term. On receiving a message, nodes verify and update. Messages with older
 * terms are discarded. A higher term causes the node to advance its term, set both the leader and vote to null, and
 * proceed with the message processing.
 * <p>
 * The leader value only updates to the elected leader (null -> new leader) or to step down (leader -> null). Updating
 * the leader directly to another throws an exception. The election vote follows the same logic.
 * <p>
 * In summary, the logic follows that updating to a received higher term sets the leader and vote to null. Later, when
 * the leader is known, the update within the same term is accepted since the current term leader is still null.

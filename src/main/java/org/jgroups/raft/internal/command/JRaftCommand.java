/**
 * JRaftCommand is a factory to create commands to submit in {@link JGroupsRaft}.
 *
 * <p>
 * We will use this factory to generate command instances that identify the specific {@link StateMachine} method to invoke.
 * These markers are stateless and can be statically created during initialization. Commands will be categorized as either read or write,
 * which should be generated using the appropriate factory methods.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * We will ensure that commands remain backward compatible by assigning unique command IDs and versions to each command. Our approach
 * involves deprecating old commands before removing them, ensuring seamless transitions when reading commands from logs and applying them to
 * the correct method in the state machine. It is essential that command creation remains synchronized with methods in the state machine.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Each command will be uniquely identified by its ID. The version argument will facilitate updates and additions of new commands to evolve a
 * state machine. Input and output types will be utilized for validation during both compilation and runtime.
 * </p>
 *
 * <b>Example:</b>
 * <pre>{@code
 * long GET_KEY_ID = 1;
 * JRaftCommand<String, String> GET_COMMAND = JRaftCommand.read(GET_KEY_ID, 1, String.class, String.class);
 * JRaft<?> raft = ...;
 * raft.submit(GET_COMMAND, "key", 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);}

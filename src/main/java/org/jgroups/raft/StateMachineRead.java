/**
 * Marks a method as a read-only operation in the Raft state machine.
 *
 * <p>
 * Read operations do not modify the state machine and can be executed locally without going through the consensus protocol.
 * This provides better performance for queries that don't require strong consistency. Read-only operations also employ the
 * optimization described in the Raft paper to ensure linearizability by checking the leader's commit index, in case
 * linearizability is required.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Each read operation must be uniquely identifiable within the state machine class by its {@code id} and {@code version} combination.
 * The same id/version pair cannot be shared between read operations.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code version} parameter enables backwards compatibility when evolving the state machine interface over time.
 * </p>

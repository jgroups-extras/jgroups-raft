/**
 * Event logger for important events in the Raft cluster.
 *
 * <p>
 * This interface provides methods to log and search for events within the Raft cluster. It is designed for use by the Raft
 * algorithm to record significant events during its operation, including those initiated by application requests. These logs aim
 * to offer insights into the cluster's behavior, aiding in debugging and monitoring. By default, this interface uses a no-op
 * implementation, allowing users to implement their own event logger if necessary.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Events</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface must be thread-safe as they may be accessed by multiple threads simultaneously. Internal events
 * logged by the Raft algorithm or application requests will be handled here. Applications do not need to log events; instead,
 * the primary method of interest is querying these logs.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Search</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * The search method enables searching for events based on specific criteria, such as a time range and attributes. Note that
 * implementations exposing events to third-party software may not need this method. This search functionality is intended solely
 * for user-facing applications, such as building dashboards.
 * </p>

[[protlist]]
== List of protocols

This chapter describes the most frequently used protocols, and their configuration.
    
Meanwhile, we recommend that users should copy one of the predefined configurations (shipped with jgroups-raft), e.g.
+raft.xml+, and make only minimal changes to it.





[[NO_DUPES]]
=== NO_DUPES

This protocol prevents duplicate members from joining the cluster. The protocol needs to be located somewhere below
`GMS`.

`NO_DUPES` catches JOIN requests from a joiner to the JGroups coordinator and checks if the joiner's `raft_id` is
already contained in the current membership, and rejects the JOIN if this is the case.

For example, if we have current members `{A,B}` and another member with `raft_id` "B" joins, then the joiner would
get the following exception when trying to join the cluster:

----

The error message is `SecurityException: join of B rejected as it would create a view with duplicate members (current view: [B|1] (2) [B, A])`,
which shows that view `{B,A}` already contains a member with `raft_id` `B`, and so the JOIN request of the new member
is rejected.

${NO_DUPES}



[[ELECTION]]
=== ELECTION

`ELECTION` is the protocol which performs leader election, as defined by Raft.
Its attributes define the election timeout and the heartbeat interval (see Raft for details).

${ELECTION}


[[ELECTION2]]
=== ELECTION2

`ELECTION2` is an alternative election algorithm.
It builds on top of <<ELECTION>> to include a pre-vote mechanism.
The pre-vote runs before delegating to the algorithm of <<ELECTION>>.

By design, <<ELECTION>> uses view changes to start election rounds and should be stable without interruptions.
`ELECTION2` is an alternative in networks with recurrent partitions that could lead to more disruptions with unnecessary election rounds.
More information about how it works is available in the design documents.


${ELECTION2}


[[RAFT]]
=== RAFT

`RAFT` is the main protocol in jgroups-raft; it implements log appending and committing, snapshotting and log compaction,
syncing of new members and so on.

${RAFT}


[[REDIRECT]]
=== REDIRECT

The `REDIRECT` protocol needs to be somewhere above `RAFT`. It keeps track of the current Raft leader and redirects
requests to the right leader. If there is no leader, e.g. because there's no majority to elect one, an exception will
be thrown.

${REDIRECT}


[[CLIENT]]
=== CLIENT

`CLIENT` listens on a socket for client requests. When a request is received, it is sent down where it will be forwarded
(by `REDIRECT`) to the current leader which executes the request. The responses is then sent back to the client.

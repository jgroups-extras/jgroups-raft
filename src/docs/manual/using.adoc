== Using jgroups-raft

Since jgroups-raft build on JGroups, we follow similar http://www.jgroups.org/manual5/index.html#Requirements[requirements].
Currently, jgroups-raft requires JDK 11. jgroups-raft can be included in the POM:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.jgroups</groupId>
    <artifactId>jgroups-raft</artifactId>
    <version>X.Y.Z.Final</version>
</dependency>
----

Where `X`=major, `Y`=minor, and `Z`=patch.
The tags are available on https://github.com/jgroups-extras/jgroups-raft/tags[GitHub releases].

=== Cluster members and identity

Each cluster member has an address (a UUID) assigned by JGroups and a `raft_id` which needs to be assigned by the user.
The latter is a string (e.g. "A") which needs to be unique in the entire cluster. In other words, the `raft_id` is the
_identity_ of a member for the sake of jgroups-raft.

A Raft cluster has a fixed size, so that a majority can be computed for leader election and appending of entries. The
members allowed into the cluster is defined in `RAFT.members`, e.g.

[source,xml]
----
<raft.RAFT members="A,B,C" raft_id="${raft_id:undefined}"/>
----

This defines a cluster of 3 members: "A", "B" and "C" (whose majority is 2).

These are the `raft_id` attributes of the 3 members, so attribute `raft_id` in the example above needs to be one of them.
If we don't start this member with the system property `-Draft_id=X` (where X needs to be "A", "B", or "C"),
then the member will start up as "undefined" is not a member of `{"A", "B", "C"}`.

NOTE: Note that while `RAFT` ensures that non-members cannot join a cluster, the `NO_DUPES` protocol makes sure that
no duplicate member can join. Example: if we have `RAFT.members="A,B,C"` and actual members "A" and "B" joined, then
a join attempt by a member with duplicate name "B" will be rejected and that member won't be able to join.

Attribute `raft_id` is also used to define the location of the persistent log; unless `log_name` is defined in
`RAFT`, the location is computed as `<temp_dir>/<raft_id>.log`, e.g. `/tmp/A.log`.

Note that members can be added and removed dynamically (without taking the entire cluster down, changing the configuration
and restarting it), see <<DynamicMembership>>.




=== RaftHandle

As shown in <<ArchitectureFig>>, `RaftHandle` is the main class users will be dealing with. It provides methods to change
state (append entries) in the replicated state machines, and a state machine can be registered with it. The state machine
will be initialized at startup and updated by jgroups-raft whenever there is a change.

A successful change is committed to the persistent logs of all cluster members and applied to their state machines, so
all state machines have exactly the same state.


==== Creation
An instance of RaftHandle is associated with exactly _one_ JGroups channel, and can be created as follows:

[source,java]
----
JChannel ch=new JChannel("/home/bela/raft.xml"); // <1>
RaftHandle handle=new RaftHandle(ch, this);      // <2>
ch.connect("raft-cluster");                      // <3>
----
<1> A new JGroups channel is created (see the JGroups manual for details on the JGroups API)
<2> A RaftHandle instance is created over the channel (which must be non-null). The second argument is an implementation
    of `StateMachine`. If null, no changes will be applied. The state machine can be set with `stateMachine(StateMachine sm)`.
<3> The channel is connected which causes the member to join the cluster


==== Making changes
The `setX()` methods can be used to make changes:

[source,java]
----
byte[] set(byte[] buf, int offset, int length) throws Exception; // <1>
byte[] set(byte[] buf, int offset, int length, long timeout, TimeUnit unit) throws Exception; // <2>
CompletableFuture<byte[]> setAsync(byte[] buf, int offset, int length); // <3>
----
<1> Synchronous change; the caller will be blocked until the change has been forwarded to the leader, which sends it to
    all cluster members which apply it to their persistent logs and ack the change back to the leader. Once the leader
    gets a majority of acks, it commits the change to its own log, applies it to its state machine and returns the
    response to the caller. The state machines thus only contain _committed changes_.
<2> Same as above, except that this call is bounded with a timeout. If it elapses before a majority of acks have been
    received, a `TimeoutException` will be thrown.
<3> Asynchronous change; this method returns immediately with a `CompletableFuture` which can be used to retrieve the
    result later, or to provide some code that's executed as soon as the result is available (e.g. `whenComplete()`).

The contents of the request and response buffers is application specific.

For example, if we implemented a replicated hash map, then a request could be a `put(key,value)`. The `put()`
would have to be serialized into the buffer, as well as the key and the value.

When committing the change, every state machine needs to de-serialize the buffer into a `put(key,value)` and apply it to
its state (see <<ImplementingStateMachine>>). If there is a return value to the `put()` call, e.g. the previous value
associated with `key`, then it will be serialized into a buffer and returned as result of one of the `setX()` calls.

==== Reading values

The `getX()` methods can be used to read the current state:

[source,java]
----
byte[] get(byte[] buf, int offset, int length) throws Exception; // <1>
byte[] get(byte[] buf, int offset, int length, long timeout, TimeUnit unit) throws Exception; // <2>
CompletableFuture<byte[]> getAsync(byte[] buf, int offset, int length); // <3>
----
<1> A synchronous call to read a value. The caller blocks until the operation is complete.
<2> Same as above, except this call has a defined timeout.
<3> An asynchronous version that returns a `CompletableFuture` and does not block the caller.

To provide high performance for read-heavy workloads, JGroups Raft implements the read-only optimization described in the Raft dissertation (Section 6.4).
This allows the leader to serve read requests without writing to the Raft log, which increases the throughput and don't grow the persistent log, which also helps during restarts.

The process works as follows: when the leader receives a read request, it first confirms with a quorum of followers that it is still the leader.
Once its leadership is verified, it serves the read request based on its current committed state.
The leader can batch several read operations and sever them together after each confirmation.
This leadership check ensures data consistency while avoiding the cost of a full consensus round for every read.

WARNING: Do *not* update the state machine using the `getX` methods. This could leave the state machine in an undefined state.


[[ImplementingStateMachine]]
==== Implementing a StateMachine

`StateMachine` is an interface and is defined as follows:

[source,java]
----
public interface StateMachine {
    byte[] apply(byte[] data, int offset, int length) throws Exception;  // <1>
    void   readContentFrom(DataInput in) throws Exception;               // <2>
    void   writeContentTo(DataOutput out) throws Exception;              // <3>
}
----
<1> This method is called whenever a log entry is _committed_. The buffer's contents are application specific (e.g this
    could be a serialized `put(key,value)` as discussed above. If there is a return value of applying the change to the
    state machine, it needs to be serialized so that it can be returned to the caller (e.g. a client).
<2> This method is called when `RAFT` needs to initialize a state machine from a _snapshot_ (a dump of a state
    machine's contents to an external stream (e.g. a file)). The `writeContentTo()` method below wrote the contents
    to a file before, in an application specific format, and this method now needs to read the contents back into the
    state machine.
<3> This method is the opposite of `readContentFrom()` and writes the contents of this state machine to a stream
    (e.g. a file).


[[Snapshots]]
==== Snapshotting and state transfer

All cluster members maintain a persistent log and append all changes as log entries to the end of the log. To prevent
logs from growing indefinitely, a _snapshot_ of the state machine can be made and the log truncated. This is done
(programmatically) with method `snapshot()`, or declaratively (see below).

This method calls `StateMachine.writeContentTo()` to dump the state of the state machine into a snapshot file and then
truncates the log. New members who don't have a log yet are initialized by sending them the snapshot first. After that,
they will catch up via the regular Raft mechanism.

Logs can be snapshot automatically by setting `RAFT.max_log_size` to the max number of bytes that a log is allowed to
grow to until a snapshot is taken.


==== Miscellaneous methods

Other methods in `RaftHandle` include:

addServer(String server):: Asynchronously adds a new member to the cluster with id `server` and returns a
`CompletableFuture<byte[]>`. See more about membership change in <<DynamicMembership>>.

removeServer(String server):: Asynchronously removes a member from the cluster with id `server` and returns a
`CompletableFuture<byte[]>`. See more about membership change in <<DynamicMembership>>.

leader():: Returns the address of the current Raft leader, or null if there is no leader (e.g. in case there was no
           majority to elect a leader)
isLeader():: Whether or not the current member is the leader
addRoleListener(RAFT.RoleChange listener):: Allows to register a  `RoleChange` listener which is notified when the current
             member changes its role (`Leader`, `Follower`, `Candidate`)
currentTerm():: Returns the current term (see Raft for details)
lastApplied():: Returns the index of the last log entry that was appended to the log
commitIndex():: Returns the index of the last log entry that was committed
raft():: Returns a reference to the `RAFT` protocol in the current member's stack. Provided for experts who need to
         access `RAFT` directly.

raftId(String id):: Used to set the `raft_id` programmatically (note that this can also be done by setting `raft_id` in
                    `RAFT` in the XML configuration. For example, the following code sets `raft_id` from the command line:
[source,java]
----
protected void start(String raft_id) throws Exception {
    JChannel ch=new JChannel("raft.xml").name(raft_id);   // <2>
    RaftHandle handle=new RaftHandle(ch, this).raftId(raft_id); // <3>
    ch.connect("raft-cluster");  // <4>
}

public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    new bla().start(args[0]);  // <1>
}
----
<1> The `raft_id` can for example be passed to the program as an argument
<2> The channel is created and its logical name set to be the same as `raft_id`. This is not necessary, but convenient.
<3> Now `raft_id` can be set via `RaftHandle.raftId(String id)`.



=== Configuration

The configuration of a member is either done declaratively via an XML config file or programmatically. Refer to the
JGroups documentation for details.

A sample XML configuration file is shown below (edited for brevity):

[source,xml]
----
<config xmlns="urn:org:jgroups"
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:schemaLocation="urn:org:jgroups http://www.jgroups.org/schema/jgroups.xsd">
    <UDP
         mcast_addr="228.5.5.5"
         mcast_port="${jgroups.udp.mcast_port:45588}"/>
    <PING />
    <MERGE3 />
    <FD_SOCK/>
    <FD_ALL/>
    <VERIFY_SUSPECT timeout="1500"  />
    <pbcast.NAKACK2 xmit_interval="500"/>
    <UNICAST3 xmit_interval="500"/>
    <pbcast.STABLE desired_avg_gossip="50000"
                   max_bytes="4M"/>
    <raft.NO_DUPES/>                                                         // <1>
    <pbcast.GMS print_local_addr="true" join_timeout="2000"/>
    <UFC max_credits="2M" min_threshold="0.4"/>
    <MFC max_credits="2M" min_threshold="0.4"/>
    <FRAG2 frag_size="60K"  />
    <raft.ELECTION election_min_interval="100" election_max_interval="500"/> // <2>
    <raft.RAFT members="A,B,C,D" raft_id="${raft_id:undefined}"/>            // <3>
    <raft.REDIRECT/>                                                         // <4>
    <raft.CLIENT bind_addr="0.0.0.0" />                                      // <5>
</config>
----
<1> `NO_DUPES`: checks that joining a new member doesn't lead to duplicate `raft_ids` in the membership. Rejects the
     JOIN if it would. Must be placed somewhere _below_ `GMS`
<2> `ELECTION`: this protocol implements leader election, as defined in Raft. It is independent from `RAFT` and could
     (and may, in the future) be replaced with a different election protocol. Attributes `election_min_interval` and
     `election_max_interval` define the range from which jgroups-raft picks a random election timeout.
<3> `RAFT`: the main protocol implementing log appending and committing, handling state machine updates, snapshotting etc.
     Attribute `members` defines the (fixed) membership (may still be redefined by `addServer`/`removeServer` log entries
     when initializing a member from the persistent log). Attribute `raft_id` defines the ID of the current member (needs
     to be an element of `members`, as discussed earlier).
<4> `REDIRECT` is used to redirect requests to the current Raft leader, or to throw an exception if no member is leader
<5> `CLIENT` listens on a socket (port `1965` by default) for client requests, executes them and sends the result back
     to the clients. Currently, `addServer` and `removeServer` has been implemented.

This is a regular JGroups XML configuration, except that jgroups-raft added a few additional protocols.

[[DynamicMembership]]
=== Adding and removing members dynamically

The `RAFT` protocol provides methods `addServer(String raft_id)` and `removeServer(String raft_id)` to add and remove
servers from the static membership (defined by `RAFT.members`). Only one server at a time can be added and removed, and
adding or removing a server needs a majority ack to be committed.

Both methods are exposed via JMX, so `jconsole` could be used. However, jgroups-raft also provides a script
(`client.sh`) to do this in a more convenient way. The script uses `Client` to connect to a member's `CLIENT` protocol
running at `localhost:1965` (can be changed). The request is then forwarded to the current leader.

The steps to add a member are as follows (say we have `RAFT.members="A,B,C"` and want to add "D"):

* Call `bin/client.sh -add D`
** If needed, `-port PORT` or `-bind_addr ADDR` can be given, e.g. if we need to reach a member running on a different host
* Once `A` (the leader) processed `addServer("D")`, everybody's `RAFT.members` is `"A","B","C","D"`
* At this point, the XML configuration files should be updated so that `RAFT.members="A,B,C,D"`
* If not, members will read the correct membership when getting initialized by their logs
* A new member `D` can now be started (its XML config needs to have the correct `members` attribute !)

Notice that membership changes survive through restarts. If a node must be removed or added, an operation must be
submitted, only restarting does not affect membership.

==== Learner nodes

JGroups Raft supports **learner nodes** to scale read-heavy applications.
Learners act as read-only replicas that mirror the leader's log but don't participate in the voting process.
Because they don't affect the quorum, you can add as many as needed.
This is ideal for reducing latency by placing nodes closer to your users without altering the core cluster's fault tolerance.

The primary role of a learner node is to facilitate safe and seamless cluster expansion.
When you add a new server directly to a Raft cluster, there's a risk of temporary unavailability because the new server needs time to catch up with the leader's log.
By adding the new server as a learner first, it can replicate the log without being a voting member.
Once it is fully synchronized with the leader, it can be promoted to a follower, gaining voting rights and becoming a full member of the cluster without any disruption.

NOTE: You can learn (pun intended) more in the https://github.com/jgroups-extras/jgroups-raft/blob/bc1702d66d6d741105d97e34fe8902b1eb8c05c8/doc/design/LearnerNodes.adoc[design document].

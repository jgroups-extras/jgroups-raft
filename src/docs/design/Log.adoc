The persistent log maintains a list of log entries, where each entry has a term and a byte[] buffer to store the command
to be applied to the state machine.

A log starts at index 1, so the first element is always unused (marker element). Indices are monotonically increasing.
Iteration works on elements in range [first_appended .. last_appended]


== Variables

- first_appended: the index of the first appended item. Initial value: 0
- last_appended: the index of the last added item. Initial value: 0
- commit_index: the index of the last committed item. Always <= last_appended. Initial value: 0


== Initial state (at the leader)

The initial log looks like this (conceptually shown as an array):

[ditaa]
----
                    0   1   2   3   4
                  ---------------------
                  | - |   |   |   |   |
                  ---------------------
                    ^
                    |
  first_appended ---+
                    |
  last_appended ----+
                    |
  commit_index -----+
----


After adding A and B:

[ditaa]
----
                    0   1   2   3   4
                  ---------------------
                  | - | A | B |   |   |
                  ---------------------
                    ^       ^
                    |       |
  first_appended ---+       |
                    |       |
  last_appended ----+-------+
                    |
  commit_index -----+
----


Now we got acks from a majority of members for index 2:

[ditaa]
----
                    0   1   2   3   4
                  ---------------------
                  | - | A | B |   |   |
                  ---------------------
                    ^       ^
                    |       |
  first_appended ---+       |
                            |
  last_appended ------------+
                            |
  commit_index -------------+
----

After adding a few more log entries:

[ditaa]
----
                    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
                  -------------------------------------
                  | - | A | B | C | D | D | E | F | G |
                  -------------------------------------
                    ^
                    |
  first_appended ---+                       ^       ^
                                            |       |
  last_appended ----------------------------+-------+
                                            |
  commit_index -----------------------------+
----

We now have 8 log entries, but thus far only committed 6.

Now the log is truncated at the last committed entry (Log.truncate(6)):

[ditaa]
----
                    6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14
                  -------------------------------------
                  | E | F | G |   |   |   |   |   |   |
                  -------------------------------------
                    ^       ^
                    |       |
  first_appended ---+       |
                    |       |
  last_appended ----+-------+
                    |
  commit_index -----+
----

* All entries from [1 .. 6] were written to a snapshot
* The array was wiped and the first entry is now the last committed entry written to the snapshot (6)
  ** This is needed because we need that entry to compare to (prev entry) on the next log append
* first_appended is set to 6

Now a log entry H with index 9 is added:

[ditaa]
----
                    6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14
                  -------------------------------------
                  | E | F | G | H |   |   |   |   |   |
                  -------------------------------------
                    ^           ^
                    |           |
  first_appended ---+           |
                    |           |
  last_appended ----+-----------+
                    |
  commit_index -----+
----

- last_appended is advanced
- commit_index will also advance when acks from the majority have been received

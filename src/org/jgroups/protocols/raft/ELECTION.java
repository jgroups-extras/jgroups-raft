/**
 * The default leader election algorithm.
 * <p>
 * Performs leader election. This implementation takes full advantage of JGroup's membership events with {@link View}.
 * When the current node is the view coordinator, it starts a voting thread to ask all members to send their information.
 * The voting thread stops when a new leader is elected.
 * <p>
 * The process that starts the voting thread is not trying to elect itself. The process running the voting process
 * increases its term and asks all nodes about their term and log index information to select the new leader, in the
 * form of {@link org.jgroups.protocols.raft.election.VoteResponse}. For safety reasons, only the nodes with the most
 * up-to-date log can be elected a leader. With a response from the majority processes, the leader with the higher term
 * and log index is elected. The oldest process (view coordinator) in the system has a priority. Once decided, the
 * process sends a message reliably to everyone identifying the new leader, with the
 * {@link org.jgroups.protocols.raft.election.LeaderElected} message.
 * <p>
 * After a leader is elected, a new election round starts on view changes only if the leader left the cluster. In case
 * of losing a majority, the leader steps down.
 * <p>
 * This implementation is more robust than building with heartbeats, leading to fewer disruptions in the cluster with
 * unnecessary (competing) election rounds. This also means the leader is capable of stepping down. Referred to in
 * ยง6.2 of Ongaro's dissertation to prevent stale leadership information.
 * <p>
 * More information is available in the design docs.

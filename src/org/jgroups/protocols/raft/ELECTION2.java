/**
 * A leader election protocol.
 * <p>
 * This implementation extends {@link ELECTION} with a pre-vote mechanism. The pre-vote always runs before starting the
 * voting thread to define the leader. The pre-vote increases the delay in electing the leader but, in turn, covers more
 * edge cases. As a rule of thumb, if deploying in an unstable network with frequent partitions, this protocol should
 * give a more stable mechanism, avoid leader disruptions, and avoid possible liveness issues. Otherwise,
 * {@link ELECTION} is the default choice.
 *
 * <p><h3>Pre-Voting phase:</h3>
 *
 * This extension includes the pre-voting mechanism proposed in Ongaro's dissertation (§9.6). In the current
 * implementation, a pre-voting phase starts in case the current node is the new view coordinator and:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The view coordinator changes and the computed update is {@link Majority#no_change};</li>
 *     <li>The computed view update is {@link Majority#reached} or {@link Majority#leader_lost}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The process which executes the pre-voting mechanism sends a {@link PreVoteRequest} to all processes in the view. The
 * recipients reply with a {@link PreVoteResponse} identifying the node they see as leader. Once the initiator receives
 * the reply from all nodes in the view, it can start the voting process, resuming the work the same as {@link ELECTION}.

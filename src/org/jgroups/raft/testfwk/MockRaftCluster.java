/**
 * Base class for the cluster implementations in the test framework.
 *
 * <p>
 * The cluster abstraction facilitates the creation of a cluster during the tests. This approach avoids the need to
 * create actual {@link org.jgroups.JChannel} and complex configurations. This abstraction provides a simplified and
 * controllable way to test the cluster, emitting events and sending messages.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The cluster abstraction works through {@link View} updates. Members are added and removed manually. When a new view
 * is received, the members receive the update accordingly and follow the synchronous configuration. The user utilizing
 * this abstraction has more control over when a member joins and which messages it receives.
 * </p>
 *
 * Our test suite contains examples of uses of the cluster abstraction.

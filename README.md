jgroups-raft is an implementation of the [Raft](https://raft.github.io/) consensus algorithm in [JGroups](http://jgroups.org/).
Users can use jgroups-raft embedded in their applications to build strongly consistent, highly available, fault-tolerant systems.


## Overview
jgroups-raft is a library offering all the guarantees the Raft algorithm provides, with features including:

* Configurable and alternatives for leader election;
* Dynamic membership changes in single-step;
* Configurable log implementations for storage;
* Member deduplication and request redirection;
* Ready-to-use building blocks.

By building on top of JGroups, jgroups-raft takes advantage of additional features with a mature and battle-tested network stack.
jgroups-raft is [verified with Jepsen](https://github.com/jgroups-extras/jepsen-jgroups-raft) to identify linearizability violations in the building blocks.

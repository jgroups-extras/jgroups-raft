The persistent log (org.jgroups.protocols.raft.Log)
===================================================
Author: Bela Ban

The persistent log maintains a list of log entries, where each entry has a term and a byte[] buffer to store the command
to be applied to the state machine.

A log starts at index 1, so the first element is always unused (marker element). Indices are monotonically increasing.
Iteration works on elements in range [first_appended .. last_appended]


Variables
----------
- first_appended: the index of the first appended item. Initial value: 0
- last_appended: the index of the last added item. Initial value: 0
- commit_index: the index of the last committed item. Always <= last_appended. Initial value: 0


Initial state (at the leader)
-----------------------------
The initial log looks like this (conceptually shown as an array):

                    0   1   2   3   4
                  ---------------------
                  | - |   |   |   |   |
                  ---------------------
                    ^
                    |
  first_appended ----
                    |
  last_appended -----
                    |
  commit_index ------



After adding A and B:

                    0   1   2   3   4
                  ---------------------
                  | - | A | B |   |   |
                  ---------------------
                    ^       ^
                    |       |
  first_appended ----       |
                    |       |
  last_appended -------------
                    |
  commit_index ------



Now we got acks from a majority of members for index 2:

                    0   1   2   3   4
                  ---------------------
                  | - | A | B |   |   |
                  ---------------------
                    ^       ^
                    |       |
  first_appended ----       |
                            |
  last_appended -------------
                            |
  commit_index --------------


After adding a few more log entries:

                    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
                  -------------------------------------
                  | - | A | B | C | D | D | E | F | G |
                  -------------------------------------
                    ^
                    |
  first_appended ----                       ^       ^
                                            |       |
  last_appended -------------------------------------
                                            |
  commit_index ------------------------------


We now have 8 log entries, but thus far only committed 6.

Now the log is truncated at the last committed entry (Log.truncate(6)):

                    6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14
                  -------------------------------------
                  | E | F | G |   |   |   |   |   |   |
                  -------------------------------------
                    ^       ^
                    |       |
  first_appended ----       |
                    |       |
  last_appended -------------
                    |
  commit_index ------


- All entries from [1 .. 6] were written to a snapshot
- The array was wiped and the first entry is now the last committed entry written to the snapshot (6)
  - This is needed because we need that entry to compare to (prev entry) on the next log append
- first_appended is set to 6

Now a log entry H with index 9 is added:
                    6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14
                  -------------------------------------
                  | E | F | G | H |   |   |   |   |   |
                  -------------------------------------
                    ^           ^
                    |           |
  first_appended ----           |
                    |           |
  last_appended -----------------
                    |
  commit_index ------

- last_appended is advanced
- commit_index will also advance when acks from the majority have been received
